I meticulously planned and developed my portfolio website, showcasing my cloud engineering capabilities. Leveraging a Bootstrap template, I customized the design to reflect my personal style. I hosted the website using AWS S3's static website hosting, ensuring high availability and scalability. For a professional touch, I configured a custom URL using AWS Route 53's DNS service.

To streamline updates, I implemented a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, which automatically deploys changes whenever I update my portfolio. This setup not only demonstrates my proficiency in coding and design but also highlights my expertise in utilizing cloud services and automation tools.
